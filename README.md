2. Methodology
2.1 Feasibility study: 
A feasibility study is a test of a system proposed plan or method according to its workability, ability to meet user needs and effective use of resources.
The major areas to be considered while determining the feasibility of this project are:
	Technical Feasibility: The current system is developed is technically feasible. It’s an easy-to-use native website with a smooth and fast user interface. Thus it provides a user-friendly experience to the users.

The result of our operational feasibility study will clearly outline that the solution proposed for the project is operationally workable and conveniently solves user’s problem under consideration after the proposal is implemented.

	Financial Feasibility: In terms of the economic cost of the development process and delivery, the cost is minimized.. The only step that would require a cost for Domain name will be a fee of $25. After registered the domain, all I need to do it contact a hosting company and tell them that I want to host my website and have a proper domain name and after that the website will be live on the WEB in no time.

2.3 Tools and technology

Well, we need to know a couple of things in order to develop a decent website. However we need to understand that there is a two sides of the developing a website. 
     As for tools I used text editor VS-Code with laetus: dark vibrant theme.  Extensions used for 
•	Debugger for Java: VS code has built-in support for javascript.js runtime and can debug javascript.

•	Live server: The live-server extension, however, automates this for you. After installing it, an automated local host will be able to run in your browser, which you can start with a single button. Once you make changes in your code or write something new, after saving it, the browser will auto-refresh itself.

•	Test runner for java: The test for java works with the language support for java, which is Run/Debug test cases. Customize test configurations. View test report.

•	Extension pack for java: the coding pack can be used as a clean installation, or to update or repair an existing development environment.





Since this is a static website, the technologies used are 

•	HTML (hyper Text markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the most basic building blocks of web coding. Without these two things, we can’t develop a website design, and all we’ll end up with is unformatted plain text on the screen. We can’t even add image to a page without HTML!

•	Responsive service section using CSS grid.
•	Resoponsive contact section using CSS flex box.
•	Responsive footer section using CSS grid.

•	JavaScript: It let us add a ton more functionality to our websites. On the most basic level, JS lets us add a lot of interactive element to our website. It makes our interface so easy to use.
•	Responsive header/navbar with toggle navbar menu and login form effect using vanilla javascript.
•	Responsive home section with parallax hover effect using vanilla javascript.

•	Swiper.js (reference 1.1)
•	Responsive vehicle touch mobile slider section using swiper.js
•	Responsive featured car section touch mobile slider using swiper.js
•	Responsive review/testimonial touch mobile slider using swiper.js
* php is also used to create the login system of the webpage(signup,signin,welcome and logout page)
* XAMPP control panel version(3.2.4) apache and mysql is used to store the database of user login history and passwords.

3. Project outcomes
If we run a car dealership then a car dealership website is supreme for us. The right kind of website helps in finding the success of an agency. Now a day, people want the experience of car dealing from the comfort of their home. Consumers interest in YouTube videos that covers the review of design, features and road test. A consumer can compare different cars, specifications or even design in a single tab with loads of car images and videos and does not note it down. Also get notification about the price changes, offers a new listing. Not only that but the buyer now has the option to book a car without going out of their home, especially when social distancing is still in place.
